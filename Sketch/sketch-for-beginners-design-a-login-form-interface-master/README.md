### Tuts+ Tutorial: Sketch for Beginners: Design a Login Form Interface
#### Instructor: Armando Sotoca

Sketch, made by the nice folks at Bohemian Coding, is an excellent program for interface design. This beginner-level tutorial will introduce you to designing with Sketch. You won't need any previous experience with the program, just some free time to spend in learning something new.

I will show you how to setup a simple artboard, how to create shapes using basic tools, boolean operations, the Inspector panel and the Layer list. We'll see how to change properties, organize layers, import images and other useful aspects of a Sketch designer's workflow.
